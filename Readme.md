# 🚀 Supervised Machine Learning: From First Principles to Engineering Applications

Welcome to this repository.

This project documents my journey through **supervised machine learning**, moving from first-principles implementations to modern, scalable solutions using libraries such as TensorFlow.

The goal is not only to make models work, but to understand **why** they work.

## 🎯 Repository Philosophy

This repository is built around three pillars:

### 🧠 1. Mathematical Foundations  

Implementation of core algorithms **from scratch**, including:

- Linear Regression  
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)  
- Classification models  
- Gradient-based optimization  

Derivations, loss functions, and training dynamics are explored explicitly.

Example formulation:

$$
\hat{y} = W x + b
$$

$$
\theta_{k+1} = \theta_k - \eta \nabla J(\theta_k)
$$

### ⚙️ 2. Modern ML Frameworks  

The same models are implemented using high-level libraries, focusing on:

- Reproducibility  
- Scalability  
- Clean training pipelines  
- Custom training loops when necessary  

This allows comparison between:

- Manual gradient implementations  
- Automatic differentiation  
- Optimization behavior  
- Convergence characteristics  

---

### 🏭 3. Engineering Applications  

Models are applied to real engineering problems, such as:

- 📡 Frequency identification in signals  
- 📈 Nonlinear system approximation  
- 🖼️ Image classification  
- 🔊 Robust regression under non-Gaussian noise  

The emphasis is on **practical modeling**, not toy datasets.
